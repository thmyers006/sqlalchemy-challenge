climate exploration and analysis using sqlalchemy

Hello, World! Welcome to my Climate Exploration Challenge using SQL Alchemy, jupyter notebook, 
Pandas and Flask.  In this challenge, I explore the data in a SQLite dataset consisting of weather 
observations in Hawaii over a seven year period starting with January 2010.

The exploration and analysis include several queries and plots centered around precipitation and
temperatures observed over a period of time.  I use Flask to publish my findings on my localhost.
